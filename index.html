    <p>
      My name is Muhammad Salisu Babatunde.I'm a passionate and goal-driven
      beginner software developer. I bring a unique perspective to the world of
      software development. I also excel at designing and developing web pages
      using HTML. I was inspired about coding when I first saw how a few lines
      of code written by my senior brother, could bring an idea to life. From
      that moment on, I was hooked! I must say I love what I do.

      HTML boiler plate is the basic structure,essential HTML code that is
      required to create a web page. It is generated using the "!" on the

      3. Differentiate between the Ordered and Unordered Lists.
      <br />
      Ordered list is a list of items that is formatted with a number. In HTML,
      It is created using the "ol" element.

      While the Unordered list on the other hand is a list of items that are
      formatted with bullet points indicating each item. In HTML, It is created
      using the "ul" element.
